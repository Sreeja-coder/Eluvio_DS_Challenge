# Eluvio_DS_Challenge

The Eluvio dataset is a collection of "News Articles titles"

# Problem Statement :
Based on the day, time, sentiment,year and number of post/author can the particular news article's up_votes cross a particular threshold and fall withing one of the bins 'low' 'moderate' and 'high'

Tried to create a tfidf of the title and passed that as data and tried to see if that helps in predicting news article's up_votes cross a particular threshold and fall withing one of the bins 'low' 'moderate' and 'high'
